# Flutter NFC P2P

This project explores the possibility of creating a peer-to-peer connection between two devices to
exchange small amounts of data in apps written in Flutter.

The proof of concept consists of generating a random value on the client which is attempted to be
sent to another client which in turn does the same. In the end, both sides should have the same
pieces of data.
